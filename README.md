# VIM - Congiguration for ultimate IDE

I have been using VIM for almost 10 years now, and after being so much used to it, I couldn't make a switch to some existing IDEs, no matter how I tried. As many other people, I felt it was too complicated for many tasks, and was seriously lacking in other areas, so I've decided to give a try to 'making VIM the ultimate IDE for writing & code development'. It was after I have found these 2 amazing articles:

  * http://wittchen.io/transform-vim-into-efficient-ide/ from [@pwittchen](https://github.com/pwittchen)
  * https://coderoncode.com/posts/vim-is-the-perfect-ide from [@amacgregor](https://github.com/amacgregor)

And after several people around me started to ask me *"how did you configure VIM to do XYZ"* I have decided to share my complete config files to have a place to point them to, and I hope some other people find it useful as well.

*My configuration of VIM is a mixture of ideas from the 2 articles above, as well as my old VIM configuration. I tried to 'document' it with comments so that even a newbie can easily disable/modify any configuration without troubles.*

Since this is my own personal VIM configuration, I won't be accepting any pull-requests. However, feel free to fork this repo for yourself, and change anything which does not suit your needs... :)

*My last note is a wish -- if you find this useful in any way, feel free to let me know, but more importantly, show some love to [@pwittchen](https://github.com/pwittchen) and [@amacgregor](https://github.com/amacgregor). Kudos to both of them -- their articles allowed me to move my VIM experience to a completely new level of efficiency and usability! ;)*
